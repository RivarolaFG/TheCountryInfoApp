Hello Everyone!
My name is Fernando, and first of all, I want to express my gratitude for this opportunity. I'm thrilled to participate, and I look forward to showcasing my work ethic and skills.

Application Setup Instructions:
To run the application, follow these simple steps:

1-Open a terminal in each application directory (backend and frontend).

2-Install the necessary modules by running the following command in both directories:
npm install
3-After the modules are installed, start both applications:
